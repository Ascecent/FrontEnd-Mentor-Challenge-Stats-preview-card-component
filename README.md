## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Normalize CSS
- Web responsive workflow

### What I learned

I've learned about variables in CSS cause this is my first time using it, also a new CSS property: 

```css
element {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```
Which describes the behavior of how the content of an element should be mixed with the content of the element behind it and the background.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about how flex works and best practices to use it also i want to learn CSS grid for future projects and improve my skills in making a responsive website.

### Useful resources

- [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - I have used this property to set the accent background, it helped me a lot :D. 
- [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - Official documentation for the custom properties :D.
